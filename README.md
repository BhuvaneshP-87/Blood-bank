# BLOOD BANK DATABASE SYSTEM
## Abstract
Blood banks and donor management systems, a system that can collect blood details from various sources, sets up a platform where the needy people who require blood can make a request. It plays a vital role in helping the medical center to collect blood details from the sources and store it in a well documented manner. To achieve these tasks, we have used PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, XAMPP server, MYSQL to set up a local system which can do all the activities as proposed. This project establishes a new dimension by connecting blood donors and blood sources, storing details in a structured way to meet the needy.

In the project, there are two main functionalities : blood sources (hospital) and receiver ( hospital ). From the blood source perspective, one can host their available blood details. The receiver then can go there with the available blood samples, and make necessary requests. The blood sources are responsible for accepting a particular request and their actions are updated to the receiver. Thus, we have established a connection between the sources and the receivers in an effective manner.
